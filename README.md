## Practical Unsupervised Learning on the Iris Dataset Using R
This project demonstrates practical applications of unsupervised learning techniques, such as clustering and dimensionality reduction, on the classic Iris dataset using R and RMarkdown.  

### 1.	Dataset

  The project uses the built-in iris dataset, which contains measurements for 150 iris flowers from three different species.  
  
### 2. Contents

- **`.Rmd`** – Source RMarkdown file with code and commentary  
- **`.html`** – Rendered HTML output (for local viewing)  
- **`.md`** – GitHub-friendly Markdown version  
- **`.pdf`** – Rendered PDF output  

### 3. Methods Used

#### a. Dimensionality Reduction
Techniques to project high-dimensional data into 2D space for visualization:

- **PCA** (Principal Component Analysis)  
- **t-SNE** (t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding)  
- **UMAP** (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection)  

#### b. Clustering Algorithms
Used to group similar data points:

- **K-Means Clustering**  
- **Hierarchical Clustering**  
- **DBSCAN** (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)  

#### c. Cluster Evaluation
Used to assess the quality and structure of clusters:

- **Silhouette Scores**  
- **NbClust**  
- **Visual Methods** (e.g., cluster plots, dendrograms)  

#### d. Data Visualization
Used for better interpretability:

- **ggplot2**  
- **factoextra**
